## Live Version

Available online at:  
**[https://noodles-simulator.up.railway.app](https://noodles-simulator.up.railway.app)**

---

## Features

- Log in and practice image-based multiple-choice questions
- Fresh mix every session; repeats are minimized
- See your progress (correct answers, totals, success rate)
- Compete on the global leaderboard
- Reset anytime to start a clean run

---

## How It Works

1. Log in and you'll get a question image with multiple answer images.
2. Pick your answer and instantly see if you're right.
3. Your stats update live; keep going to climb the leaderboard.
4. Want a clean slate? Use the reset option from the main page.

---

## Notes

- The quiz aims to minimize seeing the same question again in a short time.
- If you reset, your personal stats start fresh (leaderboard is separate).
- For feedback or issues, open a discussion on GitHub.
